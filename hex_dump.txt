hex_dump <HEX file name>

Dumps the contents of a Intel HEX file to standard output.  See the
IHEX_BIN documentation file for a description of the HEX file format as
supported by this program.  The address range, number of bytes, and the
byte values are shown for each HEX file data line.  Lines with control
information, like base addresses, are not shown, but the state set by
those lines is updated accordingly.
