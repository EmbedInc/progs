rdbin <file name>

Writes the data in the file as hexedecimal bytes, 16 bit integers, 32
bit integers, 32 bit floating point, and ASCII characters.  Each line
of output represents eight bytes from the input file.  This program may
be useful to inspect binary files.


COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

    -R

         Reverse the byte order when interpreting more than one byte as
         a number.  This may be necessary to properly read files
         written on Intel or DEC machines.  The default works properly
         on Motorola CPUs and most Unix workstations.
