                             26 January 2023

server [options]

Execute a program in a separate process, which is then left to run on its
own.  In effect the new process becomes a server that continues running
after the SERVER command exits.

The command line options are:

  -IN <dir>

    Sets the initial directory for the new process.  The default is the
    current directory when SERVER is run.

  -WAIT <seconds>

     Wait the specified time before releasing the process.  The process is
     checked before it is released to see if it has already stopped.  If
     so, SERVER returns with an error if the process exited with an error.
     During the wait time, the standard output and error streams of the
     process are connected to the standard output error streams,
     respectively, of SERVER.  If the wait time expires before the process
     exits, then SERVER will exit normally leaving the new process
     running.

     The default is to release the process immediately without checking
     how it may have completed.

  -RUN <command line>
  <command line>

     Gives the command line to run in the separate process.  All SERVER
     command line tokens after -RUN are passed to the process, so -RUN
     must be the last SERVER command line option, if used.  The process
     command line can also be implied (without the -RUN option) if its
     first token does not start with a dash (-).  There is no default
     command line.  It is an error if no command line is supplied.

Note that there is no I/O connection to the new process once SERVER exits.
The program STDIO can be useful to launch a server process with its
standard I/O connected to system files.
