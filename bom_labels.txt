bom_labels [options]

Creates a SLIDE program include file from a BOM for making a label for
each part type in a kit.  The procedure for producing a compatible BOM is
described in the CSV_BOM program documentation file.

To make the input file for this program from a compatible BOM, export the
BOM to a comma separated file.

The SLIDE program include file produced by this program is called
LABEL_BOM.INS.SL and is written to the ~/eagle/sl directory.  It is
intended to be used with the LABE_BOM.SL slide program.  This SLIDE
program positions the text appropriately for each label for printing onto
a sheet of labels.

The total quantity required for a build, a description string, and the
list of component designators for that part are written to the label.
These are intended to facilitate filling the kit as well as building it.

The command line options are:

     -IN filename
     filename

       Specifies the name of the .CSV input file.  The first form of this
       command line option (with the -IN keyword) works in all cases.  The
       second form is for convenience only and does not work if the file
       name starts with a dash (-).
