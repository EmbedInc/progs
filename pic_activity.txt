pic_activity

Make a list of recent PIC firmware development activity by quarter.
Activity is determined by HEX files and their time stamps in the SRC
directory.  Activity is listed by quarter year, including the current
quarter and the previous four complete quarters.

For each quarter, the released firmware versions created that quarter are
shown sorted by source directory, then project name, then version number.
