rename_sym [options]

Renames all occurances of one symbol name with another.  Pascal syntax
rules are used to determine what is a symbol, comment, etc.

Only root symbol names are changed in executable code, not fields within
records.

The command line options are:

  -F filename
  filename

    Specifies the name of the file that will be edited.  The short form of
    this option without the "-F" keyword may be used if the file name has
    not been previously set and it does not start with a dash.

  -OLD name
  name

    Specifies the name of the symbol to change.  The short form of this
    option without the "-OLD" keyword may be used if the file name has
    already been given, the old symbol name not given, and the name does
    not start with a dash.

  -NEW name
  name

    Specifies the new name to substitute for the symbol.  The short form
    of this option without the "-NEW" keyword may be used if the file name
    and old symbol names have already been given, the new symbol name has
    not been given, and the name does not start with a dash.
