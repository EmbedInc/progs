delt [options]

This program deletes an arbitrary file system object.  If the file
system object is a directory, then the whole directory tree is
deleted.  If the object is a link, then the link is deleted, not the
object the link is pointing to.

The command line options are:

  <object name>

       When a command line option is encountered that does not start
       with a dash (-) it is assumed to be the name of the object to
       delete, if this name has not already been set.  This form of
       specifying the object name is for convenience, and does not work
       when the name starts with a dash.  The -NAME command line option
       works in all cases.  There is no default object name.  It is an
       error if no object name is supplied.

  -NAME <ojbect name>

       Explicitly set the name of the object to delete.  There is no
       default object name.  It is an error if no object name is
       supplied.

  -NSHOW

       Suppress listing objects and other status to standard output as
       the command progresses.  By default, such information is
       listed.
