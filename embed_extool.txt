embed_extool

Installs hooks from the Embed Inc environment to external tools.  Most
hooks are symbolic links in the Embed EXTERN tree to the actual location
of specific files wherever they might be installed.

Currently hooks for the following tools are installed.

  Microchip MPLAB, in EXTERN/MPLAB

    These hooks are required for building and debugging PIC and dsPIC
    firmware.

  Microsoft Visual Studio, in EXTERN/MSVC

    Links are created for running the IDE, C compiler, librarian, and
    linker.  Some additional state specific to the particular installation
    of MSVC is also cached.

  /TEMP directory

    Some of the Embed Inc scripts assume that temporary files can be
    created in /temp.  If "/temp" does not resolve to a existing file
    system object, /temp is created as a directory.

The program prompts the user for all required information.  Run the
program for more information.

If changes are made to system startup state, then the program will reboot
the system when finished.  The user is prompted before this happens to
provide a opportunity to close other programs and the like.
