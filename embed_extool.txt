embed_extool

Installs hooks from the Embed Inc environment to external tools.  The
hooks include environment variable settings, symbolic links, etc.
Currently hooks for the following tools are installed.

  Microchip MPLAB

    MPLAB can be installed into any directory.  If C30 is used, it must be
    installed to the "MPLAB ASM30 Suite" directory within the MPLAB
    installation directory.  Several environment variables and symbolic
    links are created or updated so that the Embed Inc build scripts can
    find the MPLAB tools.  These tools are required for building PIC
    firmware.

  Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0

    This compiler is used to build host code for Windows systems.  Several
    environment variables are created or updated.  A directory in the
    Visual Studio part of the installation is also added to the command
    search path.  The compiler and linker can't work without that, even
    when Visual Studio is not run.  Some of the executables apparently
    require DLLs from this directory.

  /TEMP directory

    Some of the Embed Inc scripts assume that temporary files can be
    created in /temp.  If "/temp" does not resolve to a existing file
    system object, /temp is created as a directory.

The program prompts the user for all required information.  Run the
program for more information.

If changes are made to system startup state, then the program will reboot
the system when finished.  The user is prompted before this happens to
provide a opportunity to close other programs and the like.
