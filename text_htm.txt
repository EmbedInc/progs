text_htm <input file name> [<output file name>]

Create an HTML file from a raw text file.  The text will be displayed in
the HTML file just like it appears in the text file.  If the input file
contains any HTML tags, browsers will display these verbatim and not
interpret them.

The default output file name is the leafname of the input file with ".htm"
appended.  The output file name will always end in ".htm" even when an
output file name is supplied on the command line and it does not end in
".htm".
