                               17 July 2006

get_pic_info <picname> [options]

Get info about a particular PIC model.  The PICNAME parameter is the
generic model name, like "18F2520" or "30F3013".

With no command line options, all the information about the particular PIC
is shown.  This includes the PIC family and class.  The family indicates
the core type.  This mostly follows the PIC model numbers except that 12
always means the 12 bit core and 16 always the 14 bit core.  The class is
either "PIC" or "dsPIC".  The subclass is usually the single letter
following the first number in the PIC name.  For example, the subclass of
16C66 is "C", and of 33FJ64GS606 is "F".

The command line options are:

  -FAM

       Write only the bare family name to standard output.  This command
       line option is intended for retrieving the family name from a
       script.

  -CLASS

       Write only the bare PIC class to standard output.  This command
       line option is intended for use in scripts where the standard
       output of this program is captured into a environment variable.

  -SCLASS

       Write only the bare PIC subclass to standard output.  This command
       line option is intended for use in scripts where the standard
       output of this program is captured into a environment variable.

  -L

       Make all output values lower case.  All output values are upper
       case by default.
