fix_gld_links <options>

Fix the links to the Microchip 16 bit linker files in the various source
code directories.

Previously, there were links in the SOURCE/DSPIC directory called gld24e,
gld24f, gld24h, gld30f, gld33e, and gld33f.  These pointed to the
directories in the MPLAB software installation directory where the linker
files to the various 16 bit PIC types were kept.  These links were
manually adjusted according to where the 16 bit tools were installed.

The method for finding any parts of the Microchip tools was changed on 30
Jul 2019.  The EMBED_EXTOOL program was updated to find where the various
MPLAB components are installed, and create links to them in the
EXTERN/MPLAB directory within the Embed software installation directory.
The GLDxxx links are now in this directory, created automatically by
EMBED_EXTOOL.  For example, the portable reference to the directory
containing the dsPIC33E linker files is now "(cog)extern/mplab/gld33e".

The program scans the whole tree rooted at the current directory looking
for old 16 bit linker file links, and updates them to the new portable
target path.  This program only needs to be run once, in the (cog)source
directory.

For any link that should be changed, the full link pathname and the
desired new link expansion are shown.  This is done whether the link is
actually changed or not.

No GIT updates are performed.  This is the user's responsibility.

The command line options are:

  -SHOW

    Only show the links that need to be changed.  The default is to make
    the changes.
