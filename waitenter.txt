waitenter [options]

Wait for the user to enter a string, then write that string to standard
output.  The command line options are:

  -PROMPT string

       Use the explicit prompt string.  The prompt string is written to
       standard output without terminating the line, then the program
       waits for the user to enter something.  The default prompt string
       is "Hit ENTER to continue: ".  The prompt string parameter to the
       -PROMPT command line option must be enclosed in quotes ("") or
       apostrophies ('') if it contains any blanks.
