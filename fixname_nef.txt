                           Program FIXNAME_NEF

Fix all the raw camera NEF file names in the current directory.  These are
named DSC_xxxx.NEF in the camera, where XXXX is a 4 digit number.  This
program renames any such file to xxxx.nef.  Note that the resulting name
will be lower case.  The case of the original file name is irrelevant.
