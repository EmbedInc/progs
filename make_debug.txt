                               21 May 2019

make_debug filename [name ... name]

This program is intended to be part of the process of building various
types of objects.  These include firmware, host programs, host libraries,
environment files, etc.  See the DEBUG documentation file for a overview
of how debugging options are defined and enabled in the Embed build
system.

The command line NAME parameters, and the list of keywords in the DEBUG
environment variable are taken as a list of debug options.  Any debug
option listed in the DEBUG environment variable is enabled.  Any debug
option listed on the command line but not in the DEBUG environment
variable is disabled.

The FILENAME parameter is the name of the file to write.  This will
contain the definition of a constant DEBUG_xxx for each of the debug
options.  The suffix of FILENAME determines the language the constant
definitions will be written in.  The recognized suffixes are:

  .bat

    Windows BAT file.  Environment variables will be created with values
    of either "true" or "false".

  .aspic
  .dspic

    PIC preprocessor file.  Bool constants will be created with values of
    True or False.

  .pas

    Pascal.  A CONST statement is written with each constant set to either
    TRUE or FALSE.

  .h

    C language include file.  A #define statement is written for each
    debug option.  Each constant is set to either "(0)" for disabled, or
    "(1)" for enabled.

  .es
  .escr

    Embed ESCR script.  Bool constants are created with values of True or
    False.

  <anything else>

    If FILENAME does not end in one of the recognized suffixes above, then
    a plain text file is written.  Each line will start with "DEBUG_xxx",
    where XXX is replaced by the name of a debug option.  Then a space is
    written, followed by either TRUE or FALSE.
