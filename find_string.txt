find_string <file> <pattern>

Search for the string pattern specified by PATTERN in the file FILE.  If
the pattern is found anywhere in the file, the file name is shown
followed by each line, with its line number, that contains the pattern.
If no line contains the pattern then nothing is written to standard
output.

PATTERN is a literal string except that the following characters have
special meaning:

  ^  -  Escape character.  The following character is used literally
        regardless of any special meaning it might otherwise have.

  *  -  Wildcard.  Matches zero or more characters.

Literal characters are case-insensitive.
