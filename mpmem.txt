mpmem [options]

Read a Microchip MPLINK map file, and show the data memory usage.  Unlike
the MPLINK map file, the length of sections are shown in decimal, and gaps
of unused memory are also shown.

The command line options are:

  -MAP <input file name>
  <input file name>

    Specifies the MPLINK map file to read.  The ".map" mandatory file name
    suffix may be omitted from the file name.

    The second version of this command line option (without the -MAP
    keyword) is for convenience, and requires that the file name not start
    with a dash ("-").
