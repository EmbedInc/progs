touch <filename>

Lets the system think the file has been modified, although no contents is
actually changed.  This causes the last modified date/time to be set to
the current date time.  It may also effect modified or backup flags
depending on the operating system.

If the indicated file does not exist, then an empty file of that name will
be created.
