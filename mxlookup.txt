mxlookup <domain name>

Looks up the MX (mail exchange) servers for the indicated domain.  MX
servers are those hosts that accept SMTP mail for the domain.

For each server, the preference, TTL, and host name are shown.  These are
listed in most to least preferred order.  A lower preference number
indicates the use of that server is more preferred.  TTL is the "time to
live" in seconds.  This is how long that entry can be considered valid
before another formal query must be made.
