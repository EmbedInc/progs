downcase_dir [options]

This program can change all file names in a directory tree to lower
case.  The complete treename of file names with upper case letters is
listed to standard output.  The command line options are:

  <target directory name>

       When a command line option is encountered that does not start
       with a dash (-) it is assumed to be the target directory name,
       if the directory name has not already been set.  This form of
       specifying the directory name is for convenience, and does not
       work when the name starts with a dash.  The -IN command line
       option works in all cases.  The default target directory is the
       current directory.

  -IN <target directory name>

       Explicitly set the target directory name.  The default target
       directory is the current directory.

  -CHECK

       Inhibit making any changes.  All the names found with upper case
       letters are still listed to standard output as usual.
