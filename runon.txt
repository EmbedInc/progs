                           Test Program RUNON

RUNON <machine name> <remote prog name> <remote arg 1> ... <arg N>

Run a program on a remote machine.  The first command line argument to
RUNON is the name of the remote machine.  The remaining command line
arguments are used to make the command line to execute on the remote
machine.  The remote command line is formed by concatenating the second
thru last argument with one space between each argument.

The standard output and error output streams from RUNON will be the
standard and error output of the remote program.  The standard input to
RUNON will be delivered to the standard input of the remote program.
RUNON's exit condition (OK, TRUE, FALSE, WARNING, ERROR) will be the
exit status code from the remote program.  In other words, the program
will appear to the local command shell as if it were being run
locally.

RUNON requires a COGSERVE server to be running on the remote machine.


Implementation Notes

  RUNON is not fully implemented.  It currently has the following
  limitations:

    1)   Standard input is not passed to the remote program.  The
         remote program's standard input is not accessible in any way.

    2)   The output from the remote program is assumed to be text, and
         is converted from the text format of the remote system to the
         text format of the local system.  For example, Windows systems
         denote an end of line (EOL) with two characters, carriage
         return followed by line feed.  Unix systems denote an EOL with
         just a line feed.

         There is currently no provision for disabling this
         interpretation.  RUNON can therefore not be used if the remote
         program produces a binary stream.
