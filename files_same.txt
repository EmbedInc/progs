Compare two text files and return exit status of 0 if they are the same.
If both files exist but differences were found then exit status 1 is
returned.  If one or both files were not found then a higher exit status
is returned but no error message written.  If an error other than not
found is encountered on attempt to open either file, an error message is
written and an exit status greater than 1 is returned.
