instek_dump [options]

Dump the screen data from a Instek GDS-800 series oscilloscope to a file.

A system serial port must be connected to the serial port of the
oscilloscope using a female to female crossover cable.  Only pins 2, 3,
and 5 are used from the DB-9 connector at each end.  Pins 2 and 3 must be
crossed between the ends, and pin 5 must be connected directly between the
ends.

The oscilloscope serial port baud rate must be set to 38.4K baud.  This
can be done with the menu sequence UTILITY > INTERFACE MENU > BAUD RATE.

The command line options are:

  filename
  -OUT filename

       Specifies the generic output file name.  The first form of this
       command line option without the "-OUT" keyword is for convenience
       and can only be used when the file name does not start with a dash
       (-). The suffix for the specific output file type may be omitted
       from the FILENAME parameter.  The default generic output file name
       is "scope".  The default output file type is CSV with suffix ".csv".

  -SIO n

       Selects the system serial line to use to communicate to the scope
       with.  The default is 1 (COM 1 on PC systems).

  -SL

       The output file will be a include file for the slide making program
       SLIDE.  The output file suffix will be ".ins.sl".  The data will be
       written as a MOVE command to the first data point and DRAW commands
       to subsequent data points.  Only the data for one channel is
       written.  By default, this is the first enabled channel.

  -CHAN n

       Specifies the 1-N number of the scope channel to write to output
       files that can only handle the data for a single channel.  This
       option has no effect for output files that can accept the data for
       multiple channels.
