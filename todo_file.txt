todo <command line options>

This program reads the input file and writes "to do" entries that have
elapsed.  A to-do entry is a single line that has the format:

  :YYYY/MM/DD.HH:MM:SS <arbitrary text>

Fields at the right end of the date/time string may be omitted, in which
case they default to the earliest time of the part of the date/time
specified to the left.  If a field is omitted, then all fields to its
right must also be omitted.  For example, these two date/time strings are
equivalent:

  2008/9/11.7:00:00
  2008/09/11.07

Both specify 7:00 am on 11 September 2008.

The program lists the entry if the current time is later than that
specified in the entry.  The full pathname of the input file is written
preceeding the list of entries if there is at least one entry written.  If
the file contains no entries or none of them have elapsed, then nothing is
written.

Any lines not matching the syntax described above are silently ignored.

If the input file name has the suffix ".info", then that suffix may be
omitted on the command line.

The command line options are:

  -IN filename
  filename

    Specifies the file to scan for to-do entries as described above.  The
    first form of this command line option (with the "-IN" keyword) is the
    general case.  The second form is for convenience only when the file
    name does not start with a dash ("-").
