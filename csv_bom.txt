This program is used as one step in producing a bill of materials (BOM)
from a Eagle design using version 5 or later.  This program is intended to
be run by the BOM Eagle ULP, but its interface is fully documented here.

The overall steps in producing a final BOM are:

1  -  Run the BOM ULP in Eagle from the board editor.  This produces a
      .CSV (comma separate values) file that provides information about
      each device.  This information includes such things as the part
      designator, library, package, and various attributes.  The detailed
      format of this file may change with different revisions of the BOM
      ULP and the CSV_BOM program.

      The BOM ULP then automatically runs this program to produce the .TSV
      file.

2  -  Import the TSV file into a spread sheet program.  The fields in the
      TSV file are delimited with tab characters.  CSV_BOM copies a
      template XLS file into the same directory as the CSV file.  This
      template has the format for the columns already set appropriately
      for the data in the TSV file.  It is therefore best to open the
      template, then import the TSV file from there.

3  -  Inspect the spreadsheet.  If the manufacturer name, part number, and
      other relevant information is not present for a part, go back to the
      schematic or the Eagle library the part came from and add this
      information.  If the information is not unique to this particular
      use of the part, add the information to the device in the library
      instead of the schematic.  Adding it to the library will save work
      in the long run because it will be the default for future designs.

      Repeat from step 1 until all possible information that can come from
      the schematic or the libraries has been added to them.  Various
      Eagle attributes are used by the BOM generation utilities.  See the
      EAGLE_ATTR documentation file for a description of the special
      attributes.

      Note that LIBRARY > UPDATE ALL will need to be run in the schematic
      or board editor before changes in a library become visible.

4  -  Add the remaining information to the BOM, such as current unit
      prices.

      The spreadsheet will automatically compute the parts cost for a
      board and a run of boards once the unit prices for each component
      are filled in.  The top left cell in the spreadsheet (A1) is the
      number of boards in a production run.  This effects the total
      quantity required for each part and the total cost of the run.

5  -  Labels for kitting can be produced from the spreadsheet.  See the
      BOM_LABELS program description for details.

The input file name on the command line must refer to a CSV file of the
format produced by the BOM Eagle ULP.

The output file will be written to the same directory as the input file
and will have the same generic name as the input file.  The output file
name will always end in ".tsv".

This program performs several tasks:

  1 - Derives the final description, value, and other fields from the raw
      information such as the library name, device name, and various
      attributes.  See the EAGLE_ATTR documentation file for a description
      of the special attributes used in this process.

  2 - Identifies common parts and groups them on the same line of the BOM
      with the quantity field appropriately set.

  3 - Writes equations in some spreadsheet cells for automatic cost
      computation.

  4 - Formats this output for reliable importing into the spreadsheet
      program.  The output file was tested with Microsoft Excel, but will
      likely work with a variety of spreadsheet programs.
