xcopyright fnam

Quick hack to remove the silly copyright notice from files that have them.
These copyright notices always seem to be on comment lines starting with
"*", then one or more blanks, then "::" with possibly other stuff
following.

If a "*" only line preceeds the copyright block, then it is delete too.

If the copyright block is its own comment block with just a "{" line
immediately preceeding and just a "}" immediately following, then the
whole comment block is deleted.

The body of the copyright message was typically:

*   :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
*   ::        CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION OF        ::
*   ::                    COGNIVISION, INC.                      ::
*   ::           PROTECTED BY THE COPYRIGHT LAW AS AN            ::
*   ::                    UNPUBLISHED WORK                       ::
*   :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

FNAM is the file to edit.  Nothing is done to the file, including
modification date/time stamp not changed, if the file is not edited.  The
".pas" file name suffix may be omitted from FNAM.
