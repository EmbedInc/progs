                         Program ALIGN_COMMENTS

ALIGN_COMMENTS <source file name> [options]

Copy a text file to another file.  The destination file is created if
not already existing, and overwritten if previously existing.  The
command line options are:

  -OUT filename

       Explicitly set output file name.  The default output file name
       is the leafname of the input file.

  -EXCL <character range spec>

       Define an exclusion within which characters will be copied
       verbatim.

  -COMM <character range spec>

       Define one comment type.

  -COMTAB n

       Set tab column for comment starts.  Only comments following
       non-blank characters on the same line will be adjusted.  The
       default is 40 except for some file types as shown below.

The <character range spec> syntax referred to above describes how a
range of characters (like an inline comment or a quoted string) are
delimeted.  A range spec must always contain at least two tokens.
These are the start and end of range recognition strings.  Additional
keywords are allowed after that.  These keywords are:

  -BOL

       The range always starts at the beginning of a line.  This means
       that the range start string is only valid if found in column 1.

  -EOL

       End of line terminates the range.  The end of range string
       becomes irrelevant if this keyword is present.

  -LINE

       The range is contrained to start and end on the same line.  It
       is an error if the end of line is encountered within such a
       range.

If no -EXCL or -COMM command line options are given, ALIGN_COMMENTS
automatically selects defaults based on the input file name suffix.
The file name suffixes and equivalent command line options for their
defaults are:
