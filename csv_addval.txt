csv_addval csv1 csv2 name2 [name1] [add]

Adds the values for the column NAME2 from CSV file 2 as the last dependent
variable to CSV file 1.  NAME2 is case-insensitive.  If NAME1 is provided,
then it will be the name given to the new value in the updated CSV file.
Otherwise, the name as found in CSV file 2 is used.

NAME2 must not be the name of the independent variable (first column) of
CSV file 2.  The variable value from CSV file 2 is linearly interpolated
as neccessary to the independent variable values in CSV file 1.  The two
CSV files therefore need not have points with exactly matching independent
variable values, but new data is only written at the existing independent
variable values of CSV file 1.

If ADD is provided, it must be a numeric value and will be added to the
input value to make the output value.

If CSV file 1 does not previously exist or is effectively empty, then it
will be created using both the independent and dependent variable values
from CSV file 2.  Only the independent and the variable NAME2 will be
written, regardless of what other information may be in CSV file 2.
