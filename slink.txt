slink [<options>]

Manipulate a symbolic file system link.  The command line options are:

  <pathname>

       Symbolic link name or link text.  The first argument not
       starting with "-" is assumed to be the name of a symbolic link.
       The second pathname argument, if present, is assumed to be the
       text for the symbolic link.  A link name is always required,
       although it can be supplied using the -NAME option, below.  The
       link text may also be supplied using the -VAL option, below.

  -NAME pathname

       Explicitly give the link name.  This method is required if the
       link name starts with "-".

  -VAL text

       Explicitly give the link text.  This method is required if the
       link text starts with "-".

  -REPL

       Replace existing file or link, if neccessary.  This is the
       default.

  -NREPL

       It is an error to attempt to create a link with the same name as
       a previously existing file or link.  The default is -REPL.

  -DEL

       Delete the link.

If only a link name is supplied, LINK will return TRUE status if the
link exists and is a link, otherwise it will return FALSE status.

If a link name and text is supplied, a new link will be created,
subject to the other command line arguments.

-DEL may only be used with link name (no link text).
