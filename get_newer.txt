get_newer [options]

This program compares the modified times of a source and destination tree,
and copies only the newer files from source to destination.

The command line options are:

  -FROM source
  source

    Indicates the source tree.  This is required.

    The second form of this command line option (without the "-FROM") is
    for convenience when typing interactively, and can only be used when
    the source tree pathname does not start with a dash ("-").

  -TO dest
  dest

    Sets the destination tree.  The default destination tree is the
    leafname of the source tree in the current directory.

    The second form of this command line option (without the "-TO") is for
    convenience when typing interactively, and can only be used when the
    source pathname has been given, and the destination pathname does not
    start with a dash ("-").

  -NCOPY

    Perform the file time comparisons but do not actually copy any files.
    This can be useful to see what files are newer in the source than in
    the destination, but without making any changes.

  -ND name

    Do not copy any directories that have the indicated name.  When such a
    directory is encountered, its entire tree is not copied.  There may be
    any number of -ND options on the command line.

  -NE

    Allow the source directory to not exist.  By default, a non-existant
    source diretory is a error.  With the -NE switch, a non-existant
    source directory causes the program to silently exit without error.
