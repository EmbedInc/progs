run_cmline <command line>

This program is for running a command line program from a program that has
no command line output but where the user must be able to see the output.
If a command line program is run directly from a GUI program, the command
line window pops away immediately when the program exist.  This program
runs the target program, but then stays until the user dismisses it,
thereby keeping the window visible until the user is done with it.
