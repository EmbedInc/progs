This program writes the data in a WAV file to a CSV (Comma Separated
Values) file.  The first CSV file column will be time in seconds, and
the remaining columns will be the channel values for that sample in -1
to +1 format.  The CSV file will be much larger than the WAV file, but
is a common format that can be understood by many programs.

The command line arguments are:

  -IN fnam
  fnam

       Specifies the input WAV file.  The ".wav" file name suffix may
       be omitted.  The second form of the command line option without
       the -IN keyword is allowed when the WAV file name does not start
       with a dash and the input file name has not already been
       specified.  There is no default input file name; an input file
       name is required on the command line.

  -OUT fnam
  fnam

       Specifies the output CSV file.  The ".csv" file name suffix may
       be omitted.  The second form of the command line option without
       the -OUT keyword is allowed when the CSV file name does not
       start with a dash, the input file name has already been
       specified, and the output file name has not already been
       specified.  The default output file name is the generic leafname
       of the input file.
